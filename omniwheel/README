Omni Wheel

Simple Omniwheel design that I threw together for small autonomous bot I have started working on

For each complete wheel:

Printed parts:
2x of either of the body designs
8x of the rollers


Hardware:
8x axels - Can use any brass/copper/steel rod that is 2mm in diameter and cut to 23mm long each
8x M3 screws - M3x4 work if you just want to thread into the plastic or M3x6 if you want to drill the holes out to 3mm and add a nut on the other side
4x M3 screws to attach to your own custom hub



Assembly:
Insert the rods into the rollers and lay them onto one side of the body with the end of the rods in the grooves going around the circumference
Lay the other side of the body facing into the first side with the grooves lining up to accomodate the axels
Use the M3x4 or M3x6 screws around the outside ring of holes to secure the rollers 
Omniwheel complete!
